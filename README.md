# Location-transportation-problem
We study a target-oriented location-transportation problem (LTP) characterized by multiple periods and uncertain demands. The objective is to determine the location of facilities, production of facilities and the shipments from each facility to each customer so as to maximize the degree of target achievement, which means we want to minimize the aggregation of risks of violation and the violation means that the actual fill rate is lower than the desired fill rate. Even though what we construct is a model with uncertain parameters, with robust optimization techniques we can get a tractable conservative approximation and this is a mixed integer programming model, which means this counterpart can be solved efficiently with Benders Decomposition algorithm and the optimal solutions are quite accurate.
